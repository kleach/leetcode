# My **LeetCode** solutions

This repository is present to show my solutions on LeetCode and to demonstrate my skills.

All solutions are placed in `src` package according to their numbers and names on **LeetCode**. Each solution is a separate package with 2 modules in it:

- `solution.py` â€” module containing the solution.
- `test.py` - `unittest`'s TestCase for testing the solution.

There is also `test` package containing `test.py` module that allows to run tests for all solutions.
